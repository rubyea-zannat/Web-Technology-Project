          <p>
            E-tickets will be automatically issued by Bangladesh Railway Portal
            within 30 minutes of successful payment. User(s) can obtain their
            ticket(s) and also download the PDF version of the ticket from the
            confirmation page. Concurrently, a copy of the ticket will be sent
            to the user’s email address. However, some mail service providers
            such as Gmail, Yahoo!, Outlook might place the email in “SPAM”
            folder. Furthermore, it might also be possible that the mail has
            been blocked by any of the mentioned service providers. However,
            email containing PDF tickets may be delayed for technical reasons.
            Therefore, unavailability of the confirmation mail should not be
            regarded as non-issuance of ticket. If the reservation does not
            materialize and the client-passenger still wants to try for the same
            reservation once again, the process will be treated as a new
            reservation. User(s) can always download the tickets from the
            “Purchase History” section of the website or “My Tickets” section of
            Rail Sheba app.

            To issue railway tickets, Bangladesh Railway Portal depends on
            different payment getaways for the Card/Wallet charge information.
            Bangladesh Railway does not store any sensitive information of
            Passengers such as Card/Wallet details, OTP, Pin Code. In case any
            Card/Wallet is charged and/or Payment Gateway fails to return the
            information in due time, it is possible that the passenger’s
            Card/Wallet would be charged without being issued for the desired
            tickets. In such instances, Payment Gateways will automatically
            refund the purchased amount by the Client-Passenger to their
            respective Card/Wallet within 8 (eight) working days. However, in
            case such a Client-Passenger does not receive refund within 8
            (eight) working days, the client Client-Passenger is requested to
            send a complaint email to support@eticket.railway.gov.bd with
            details of the issue. A reply to such a Client-Passenger will be
            sent within 7 working days. Due to the dependency on payment service
            providers, it might take several days to resolve the issue. For a
            refund of unsuccessful purchases and card charging issues,
            Client-Passenger must contact the Payment Service Provider through
            which s/he made the transaction. For a refund of successfully
            purchased tickets, the Client-Passenger must visit their respective
            originating station (i.e., Departure Station from which the
            Client-Passenger will travel) and contact the refund counter.
            Bangladesh Railway or Shohoz-Synesis-Vincen JV will not be held
            responsible for the non-issuance of tickets or delay of refund due
            to errors in payment processing or any other reasons that are beyond
            the control of Bangladesh Railway or Shohoz-Synesis-Vincen JV.
            Bangladesh Railway makes no guarantee/warranty that any of the above
            services will be uninterrupted, timely or error-free due to the
            dependencies on many Service Providers.
